# Ukthar
%% [[Guf]] / [[Guf Cultures]] %%

The Ukthar are a collection of distinct druidic tribes that work together to preserve the sanctity of nature. Each tribe has their own idea of what that means, but they generally revere plant and animal life and chafe against any form of industrialization or central governance. The sheer magical prowess of each tribe's druidic representatives serves only to augment their confirmation bias of this fact. ^9f7e0e
