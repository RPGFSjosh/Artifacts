# Susavon
%% [[Eschwen]] / [[Eschwen Cultures]] %%

The Susavon are primarily an avant-garde society in the Susa region of Freice. Their social hierarchies are based on achievement in the arts and philosophies. This extends to their education and civil engineering, favoring high-gothic architecture and open universities with only subtle distinctions between master and student. Socially, they value novelty, expression, and cunning. Their leaders and politicians move through both the common public and criminal syndicates with only the loosest allegiances to either. ^42dcc6
