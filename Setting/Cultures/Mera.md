# Mera
%% [[Hrod]] / [[Hrod Cultures]] %%

The Mera live in a subtropical convergence of river valleys. They build massive open-air temples with cyclopean pillars and giant pyramids of polished stone. Their society blends religion with agriculture and is highly stratified by a strict caste system. As a nation, they see themselves as superior to others and are non-interventionist, though individuals have the authority to do as they wish abroad. ^b186d2
