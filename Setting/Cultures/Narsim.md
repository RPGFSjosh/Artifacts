# Narsim
%% [[Savothian]] / [[Savothian Cultures]] %%

The Narsim have embraced their biological immortality as proof that experiences of the flesh are all that matter. They are hedonistic and indulgent, laughing in the face of sacred mores as they abuse magic as a way of permanently modifying flesh for greater pleasure. Their only taboo is against murder of any kind, seeing it as the ultimate rejection of their central gift. ^840c0d
