# Elooaak
%% [[Krex]] / [[Krex Cultures]] %%

The Elooaak are never far from the sea, preferring roles of longshoremen and deep sea fishermen. They worship the mystery of the sea and often disappear for years at a time without ever touching shore. While most travel in galleons and other larger boats, the traditionalists prefer to test their mettle for weeks at a time while alone in a canoe, eating only what they can catch by spear. ^c8b180
