# Umur
%% [[Gelt]] / [[Gelt Cultures]] %%

The Umur hollow out mountains for their homes. Possibly the most regimented and complex Gelt society. They operate almost entirely within an overlapping structure of guilds. One Gelt can be a member of several guilds at once, leading to innumerable combinations of social, political, and economic allegiances that are maintained during conflicts of interest by strict rules of etiquette upheld not just by propriety but also their justice system. ^27eb56
