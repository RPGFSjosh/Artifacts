# Idon
%% [[Eschwen]] / [[Eschwen Cultures]] %%

The Idon are a loose collection of nomadic peoples with a complex reliance on musical traditions. Almost every aspect of their allegiances, hierarchies, trade practices, and values are described by epic songs. Each clan has their own versions of each, highlighting their heroes. Whether the practices or songs came first isn't known. The existence of epic songs has elevated the strongest and most clever ancestors of Idon culture to the status of near-mythical demigods. Young Idona aspire to reach such heights. ^8d13c4
