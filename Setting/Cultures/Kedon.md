# Kedon
%% [[Hrod]] / [[Hrod Cultures]] %%

Desert-faring tribal nomads, the Kedon worship and fear the blazing sun. Needing less water to survive in the heat, entire Kedon tribes will often disappear for months at a time on pilgrimages deep into the heart of the Palronna desert to see sights that they do not share with the rest of Urd. ^fcf123
