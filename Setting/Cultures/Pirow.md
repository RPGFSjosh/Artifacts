# Pirow
%% [[Hrod]] / [[Hrod Cultures]] %%

The Pirow thrive in the thickest marshes and swamps. They have shorter snouts and darker skin than other Hrod and have a greater focus on small family groups rather than greater tribes. The difficulty of travel within their territory has given them an air of dark mystery with some rumors alleging forbidden magics. ^33b6e7
