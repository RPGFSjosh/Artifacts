# Cyleah
%% [[Gelt]] / [[Gelt Cultures]] %%

Physically resembling otters, wolverines, and badgers, the Cyleah live in the gelid North, making their homes in glacial ice and surviving chiefly off of the wealth of the sea. They are hardy, superstitious, and suspicious of outsiders. It is difficult to earn their respect, but once earned, it is fiercely defended. ^1d12b8
