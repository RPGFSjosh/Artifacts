# Larsa
%% [[Eschwen]] / [[Eschwen Cultures]] %%

Military and religious hierarchies are one and the same for the Larsa. They recruit the sick, dying, and disenfranchised of their enemies by creating hospitals and relief efforts before gradually eroding their borders and invading en-masse. They are the night-time bogeymen of children stories meant to warn against their predatory kindnesses. ^1cff3a
