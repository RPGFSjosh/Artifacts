# Cyne
%% [[Guf]] / [[Guf Cultures]] %%

The Cyne are a waterfaring people with a strong focus on seamanship. They work as riverboat captains, merchant marines, coast guards, and pirates. Their reach is so vast, their culture only has one true center, the floating city of Cere, a collection of thousands of ships lashed together, riding the currents of Urd. ^9ea995
