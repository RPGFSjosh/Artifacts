# Negrithil
%% [[Guf]] / [[Guf Cultures]] %%

Negrithil's inception followed a brutal military campaign that lasted a century, leaving behind a stable republic. They have standardized everything from education to military training to a degree that no other current culture of Urd can match. They operate under a strict democracy that champions duty and individual responsibility so much that any undermining of these precepts through corruption or weakness is seen collectively as a crime near to blasphemy. ^d93674
