# McGarrgl
McGarrgl is a highly intelligent and hyper inventive [[Hrod]] known for fabricating and selling powerful items meant to emulate the abilities of magical artifacts through absurd feats of engineering. His creations are known for being incredibly powerful if not particularly stable.

Over recent years, he has found himself in direct opposition to the [[Leyliners|Leyliners]], as he is offering cash to submit powerful artifacts to him rather than have them donated to a Leyliner Archive.
