# Leyliners
There are many adventuring companies and outfitters spanning the world of [[Urd|Urd]], but none is more ubiquitous and trusted than The Leyliners. They have a strict vetting process and an established Code of Conduct that has kept their name in the high flying adventure stories and tales told to children for generations.

## Purpose
To accrue and categorize lost knowledge through adventure archaeology. People and institutions hire Leyliners to help them retrieve some component of lost academic or ancestral value. In keeping with their contract, the Leyliners may catalogue everything found, including the experience, as well as retain any additional unspecified artifacts. Discretion may be negotiated as part of the contract with a period of months or years before the information may be made publicly available.

They do this work to reconstruct what they call "The Timeline," a coherent representation of the history of Urd as well as the now lost technological advancements that their entire world sits atop.

## Archive
After most adventures, individual companies of Leyliners need to drop off various artifacts for study and cataloguing. Within most large cities and a few outposts, there is a Leyliner Archive, which is where these items are received. 

Leyliners and research students are granted tiered access to the contents of these caches relative to an item's value or danger.
 
Local governments offer their support to house and guard their local Archive, as there is an uncertainty about the relative danger of the artifacts within, which is believed to act as a deterrent for invasion. If the Leyliners know that there is a powerful ancient bomb, who's to say they can't turn it against an invader?

This has not yet happened in practice, but most would prefer to err on the side of caution.

## The Index
Leyliner central administration is referred to as "The Index." Indexers receive reports from the archives to add information to The Timeline. They also identify knowledge gaps, discrepancies, and potentially profitable ruins for Leyliners to explore.

## Publications
### The Byliner 
A monthly publication that contains etchings of discoveries, interviews, adventure accounts of multiple Leyliners.MC
## Rules
- Leyliners may not hold public office. If they do, they lose all access.
