 # Pharmacon Society

The Pharmacon Society is the largest organizations of physicians on Urd. Their members travel the globe and maintain a network of communication about sharing the newest medicines and techniques for care of the sick.

Even though they are near the edge of inventing something akin to scientific rigor, they still treat the practices that work as established and sacred rites.

These rituals include, but are not limited to:
- Burial
- Hand Washing
- Surgery 

Each member refers to themselves and other members as a "Peer" of the Pharmacon Society. To be accepted as a Peer, nine Peers in good standing must vouch for your induction.

Each subject-matter has a subject-matter expert that administrates the dissemination of new information. This person is known as a "Chair." For instance, all new developments regarding tooth decay would submit their findings to the Chair of Dentistry.

Every ten years, the peers convene to elect a new Dean and share progress at the Peermoot. It doubles as a religious function.
