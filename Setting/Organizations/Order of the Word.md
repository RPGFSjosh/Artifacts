# Order of the Word
## Description
The Order of the Word is the primary method of package and information delivery in Urd. It has existed since long before the Age of Equity and is largely regarded with more respect than even the most benevolent-seeming governments.

Each member of the Order is an Officer of the Word and is expected to hold themselves to uncompromising standards when it comes to personal integrity and unflinching dedication to their work.

The Order champions 3 tenets.

- Duty
	- Nothing must interrupt the Word.
- Liability
	- Any individual or faction who impedes an Officer from delivering the Word will be held accountable the world over.
- Neutrality
	- All versions of the Word are equally important, and Officers take no sides in the affairs of religions or nations.

Each officer carries a high quality dagger as a neck knife that symbolizes a letter opener. The brass pommel of which acts as a stamp unique to each Officer. This stamp is used as a signature, an identifier, and a tool for evaluating the routes of letters. Officers are encouraged to use their daggers and maintain them as a primary tool, whether it is for skinning game, building shelters, or even opening correspondence from fellow officers. 

In the event of something insurmountable by a lone Officer or injury, an Officer of the Word may deputize any willing adult. That adult will be compensated for their time in the form of whichever currency they use.

Officers too old or injured to be carriers often become Abbots, managing central distribution centers and caring for the road-beaten carriers who come to them with new information for the Order, such as news, history, or updates to their sophisticated maps.

## Divisions
### Express
For an substantial fee, the Order will dedicate one or more officers to focus solely on the delivery of a client's package as quickly as possible. They are empowered to secure travel and even commandeer services and items to reach their destination faster, fully compensating anyone inconvenienced. 

### Dead Letters
Undeliverable letters get sent to the nearest Dead Letters division. Officers do their best to locate the family of any deceased, but many letters end up here due to there being no possible owner due to war or just the vagaries of how people choose to address them.

Generally, the only civilians allowed to open these letters who aren't the intended recipient are historians, but they are first heavily vetted by the department and may only receive transcriptions of the original documents, as everything is very carefully catalogued.

### Inspectors
Whenever a crime is suspected of having been committed internally or externally against the Order, an Officer Inspector will arrive and recruit any local law enforcement or trusted private investigators to solve the issue. If none are available, Inspectors have been known to hire mercenaries to enforce consequences when local laws don't exist. Liability is a core tenet, after all.
