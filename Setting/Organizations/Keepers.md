# Keepers
More ancient than anyone can remember, the Keepers are the sacred guardians of [[Urd|Urd]]. Few in number, they stand for justice and fairness in all things. It is rare that one is encountered, and little is known about their order or how they recruit, but one law has remained in the oral history of the people longer than the litany of fallen kingdoms it survived: When a Keeper calls for aid, all good people must stand with them. A keeper is subject to a very strict code, one that completely eschews ownership, compelling them to give their possessions to others in need and to be unabashed in asking for what they need, themselves.
