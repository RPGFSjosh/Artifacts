# [[Initiative|Initiative]]
Initiative determines who gets to act first in [[Combat|Combat]]. When combat begins, the players roll for Initiative.
- Encounters have a pre-established [[Initiative Difficulty]].
- Players add their level plus [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] or [[Intellect|Intellect]] (whichever is higher) to their Initiative Roll.
- Players whose results meet or beat the Initiative Difficulty may use a [[Swift Actions|Swift Action]], [[Move Actions|Move]] half their speed, or [[Disengaging|Disengage]] as an [[Immediate Actions|Immediate Action]] before Combat begins.
- If at least half of the players meet or beat the difficulty, [[Battle Order|Battle Order]] begins with their side going first.
