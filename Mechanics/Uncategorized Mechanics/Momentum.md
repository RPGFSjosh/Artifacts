# Momentum
Momentum is the reward for daring actions, the resource spent to augment rolls, and the currency used to advance down [[Paths|Paths]].

## Earning Momentum
At any point during the game, the [[Game Master]] can dispense Momentum to individual players, usually only 1 point at a time. Clever problem-solving, hilarious jokes, dramatic roleplay, and creative combat actions are just some of the behaviors that a GM can encourage through Momentum rewards. Players are allowed to argue that something they did deserves Momentum, and GMs are expected to be fairly generous.

You gain Momentum at the end of [[Scenes|Scenes]] in fixed amounts. The difficulty or significance to the [[Campaign]] determines the reward.

| Difficulty | Momentum Awarded |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | 3 |
| Difficult | 4 |
| Heroic | 5 |
| Story Climax | 6+ |

## Spending Momentum on Rolls
Any time you roll a d20, you may spend any amount of Momentum you like. Spending Momentum in this way signifies a significant moment in your characterâ€™s story. Before making the roll, declare how many Momentum you would like to spend. Then, describe the flourish or the dramatic importance of the action. You may have a quippy line, or you may just describe the desperate way in which this strike is different.

For each point spent on the roll, roll an additional d6 and add to the result.

If you spend Momentum and still fail the roll, a dramatic consequence follows, decided by the GM. You may lose hold of your weapon, the floor could open underneath you, or the monster that has bitten you may accidentally swallow you.

Whatever happens before you roll the d20, you have decided that the outcome will be important.
