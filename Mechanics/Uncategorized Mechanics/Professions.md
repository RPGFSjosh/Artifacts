# Professions
A Profession describes a set of skills and experience that a character can draw upon to shape how they interact with the world around them. It gives them a +3 bonus to any skill check associated with their Profession.

For instance, here we have two characters. One is a Physician, and the other is a Detective. 

Both Professions involve speaking to people, but in the context of a criminal interrogation, the Investigator would add the Profession bonus to their Intellect score for the roll, and the Physician would not.

In a scene where the Player Characters wanted to lie to an NPC, convincing it that it had been infected by a fictitious disease, the Physician would add their Profession bonus to their Composure score for the roll, and the Investigator would not.

There is a lot of flexibility and infinite context-specific use cases. GMs are expected to use their best judgment on when a Profession bonus should apply, and Players are expected to make their best case and accept the GMâ€™s decision.

### Advancing a Profession
You may spend 10 [[Momentum|Momentum]] to increase a Profession by 1 Point. You may choose to instead gain a new Profession and add 1 Point. 
You may only increase a Profession after a certain amount of in-game time has passed relative to the total points you already have in the profession. 
Your character must have spent at least some time during that span actively engaging in the chosen profession. 
Every 3 times you do this, you level up and gain 4 [[Hit Points|Hit Points]].

| --- | --- |
| First Point | 3 Days |
| Second Point | 1 Month |
| Third Point | 3 Months |
| Fourth Point | 6 Months |
| More than Four | 1 Year |
