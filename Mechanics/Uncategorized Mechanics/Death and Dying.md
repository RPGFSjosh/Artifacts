# Death and Dying

## Death Score
When your character drops to 0 [[Hit Points|Hit Points]], they fall unconscious and begin dying. Every round on your turn, your character gains 5 [[Death Score]]. Any additional damage taken while at 0 Hit Points, such as from area effects or [[Bleeding|Bleed]] adds to your Death Score rather than subtracting further from your Hit points. When your Death Score equals or exceeds your remaining [[Momentum|Momentum]], your character dies.

## Healing
When you receive [[Healing]] while dying, you heal from 0 Hit Points and immediately regain consciousness. You then roll for a [[Traumas|Trauma]]. Your Death Score persists.

## Recovery
For every hour your character spends fully resting, your Death Score is reduced by 1.
