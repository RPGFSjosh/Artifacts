# [[Knowledge Checks|Knowledge Checks]]
When a character's knowledge regarding a creature, place, item, culture, person, or any number of things is uncertain, the GM may call for a Knowledge Check. The difficulty of the check is determined by how prevalent the knowledge is.

| Knowledge Ubiquity | Difficulty |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Obvious            | No check   |
| Common             | 5          |
| Picked up          | 10         |
| Rarely Referenced  | 15         |
| Specialized        | 20         |
| Hidden             | 25         |
| Secret             | 30         |

Knowledge checks only apply when they regard something that could possibly be known about a topic. If asking whether or not a character may know an unspoken thought that another may have had, or the contents of a private conversation, it would be inappropriate to ask for a check.

Inversely, if the knowledge is extremely uncommon but is fundamental to a character's chosen [[Professions|Profession]] or agreed-upon backstory, then it is assumed that the character already has that knowledge.

If a player wishes to spend [[Momentum|Momentum]] on a Knowledge check, they must first tell the story of how their character may have come across the knowledge beforehand.
