### Intimidation
Intimidating an NPC requires a [[Composure|Composure]] roll targeting their Composure Defense. The amount by which you exceed their defense determines the outcome. If you fail the roll, subsequent Intimidation rolls against that target by everyone in the [[Scenes|Scenes]] increase in difficulty by 2.

| Degree of Success | Result |
| --- | --- |
| +0-1 | Target suffers -1 to all rolls until the end of your next turn. |
| +2-3 | Target suffers -1 to all rolls and defenses for 3 [[Rounds]]. |
| +4-5 | Target suffers -1 to all rolls and defenses for 3 [[Rounds]] and cannot attack you for 1 round unless you are the only target remaining. |
| +6-7 | Target suffers -1 to all rolls and defenses until the end of the Scene and cannot attack you or your Allies for 2 rounds. |
| +8 or more | target drops any weapons they are carrying and flees. |

If the presence of visible members of a group are being used to intimidate, the GM may ask to treat the check as a [[Group Skill Checks|Group Skill Check]]
