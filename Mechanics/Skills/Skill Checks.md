# Skill Checks
When a Character wishes to perform a Skill check, whether to succeed at an action, know a fact, or impose their will on an NPC, they will roll a d20 and add one of their associated [[Attributes|Attributes]] to the result.

Basic guidelines for Skill roll difficulty:
  
| Difficulty | Description |
| --- | --- |
| No Check | The skill is something any able-bodied creature could do, or it is a skill associated with the most basic function of the Character’s Profession or a necessary component of their backstory, such as knowledge of their own family’s names and recent history |
| 1-5 | Easy, but failure isn’t uncommon |
| 6-10 | Simple, though requires some focus |
| 11-15 | Middling difficulty. Usually the realm of those trained or experienced in the skill |
| 16-20 | Difficult. For those with little or experience or knowledge, success would be surprising |
| 21+ | Expert |
| 30+ | Success may appear impossible |

## Specific Uses
### Rolling Against a Target's Defense

### Bolstering
Sometimes when other members of the party could have made a skill roll for the same check, they would rather the character with the greatest bonus to roll for themselves or the group as a whole. In this instance, each bolstering player may donate Momentum for a +1 bonus to the roll for each point spent.

### Spot
You can make an [[Intellect|Intellect]] roll to try to spot something from your character’s current perspective. The difficulty of this check only has to do with how obvious or obscured the subject is.

| Difficulty | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Obvious |
| 5 | Inconspicuous |
| 10 | Obscured |
| 15 | Hidden |
| 20+ | Well-Hidden |

#### Light Levels
How dimly lit an area is can add to the difficulty of your [[Intellect|Intellect]] checks to spot unlit objects or creatures. The difficulty increases with distance.

| Conditions | Difficulty |
| --- | --- |
| Well Lit | +0 |
| Dim | +1 per 10 Feet |
| Dark | +1 per 5 Feet |
| Black | +2 per 5 Feet |
| Pitch | +10 per 5 Feet |

### Listen
You can make an [[Intellect|Intellect]] roll to try to spot something from your character’s current perspective. The difficulty of this check only has to do with how obvious or obscured the subject is by other noises.

| Noisiness | Difficulty |
| --- | --- |
| Clear | +0 |
| Murmur | +5 |
| Buzz | +10 |
| Racket | +15 |
| Cacophony | +20 |

### Diplomacy
Convincing an NPC requires a [[Composure|Composure]] roll targeting a difficulty set by the GM based on the NPC’s receptiveness.

| Receptiveness | Difficulty |
| --- | --- |
| Willing | +0 |
| Receptive | +5 |
| Hesitant | +10 |
| Opposed | +15 |
| Hostile | +20 |

### Bluff
Bluffing an NPC requires a [[Composure|Composure]] roll targeting their [[Intellect|Intellect]] Defense. The amount by which you exceed their defense determines the outcome. If you fail the roll, subsequent Bluff rolls against that target by everyone in the Scene increase in difficulty by 2.

| Degree of Success | Result |
| --- | --- |
| +0-1 | Doubting. "It seems unlikely, but you seem to think it's true." |
| +2-3 | Cautious. "This bears considering." |
| +4-5 | Interested. "Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter." |
| +6-7 | Convinced. "Shut up and take my money!" |
| +8 or more | Indoctrinated. "I don't care what anyone says! I believe you." |

### Grappling
To grapple a target, a character must spend one of their [[Attack Actions]] to perform a [[Melee Attacks|Melee Attack]] with an empty hand. If it hits, the strike deals no damage, but both they and the Target become [[Immobilized|Immobilized]].

The Grappler then rolls and adds either their [[Strength|Strength]] or their [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] to the result, setting the Grapple Difficulty. As an Attack Action on their subsequent turns, the Grappler may reapply the Grapple, which allows them to reroll the Grapple Difficulty in the hope of getting a higher result.

While Grappled, both Characters grant [[The Upper Hand|The Upper Hand]] to all melee attackers, including each other.

On their turn, the victim of the Grapple may spend just one Move Action to attempt to escape. They roll and add their Dexterity or their Strength to the result. If the result is higher than the Grapple Difficulty, the Grapple ends, and they are no longer Immobilized.
