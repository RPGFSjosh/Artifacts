# Strength
Strength is the amount of physical power your character has. It describes how much you can lift and carry, the distance you can throw an object, the size of [[Bow]] you can draw, and the effectiveness of your Strength-Based [[Skill Checks]]. Your Strength score is added to [[Damage Rolls]] with melee attacks.
