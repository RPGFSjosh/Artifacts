## Thrown Weapons
Strength determines the maximum distance that thrown weapons are effective. 2 spaces + 2 more spaces for every point of Strength you have. For every space by which your range is exceeded, your chance to hit is reduced by 1, and your damage is reduced by 5. Difficulty to hit an area with a thrown object is 5. Range for improvised thrown weapons is 30 feet, reduced by 1 space for every 2 pounds. Damage of improvised thrown objects is 1/2 the weight in pounds + level = Dice Tier + STR
