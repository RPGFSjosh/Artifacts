## Description
The Auto-Portrait consists of a shiny black box run through multiple times with tubes of every shape and length.  Aconical depression sits in the side that faces the subject with a pinprick hole. It is meant to be operated along with a stage the consisting of a five foot diameter ceramic circle surrounded by four upright poles equidistant from one another.

## History
The Auto-Portrait was developed as a novel way of storing an image of someone without having to hire a painter. It would capture the image of a person in front of it for later projection upon a surface, almost like the inverse of a shadow. 

The first time the Auto-Portrait was tested, instead of storing the image on the film plates within, it created a copy of the subject five feet away from the subject except made of blue light. The recreation was completely autonomous and had full knowledge of its life as the subject and was very confused and disturbed by it's existence.

The copy was accidentally destroyed  by the removal of the film from the camera and could not be recreated by reinserting it. The subject was distraught but was mollified by a large sum of akies and a cover story that this was all an elaborate illusion being tested for a magic show.

Further tests were just as confounding and disturbing but testing was halted to preserve film and to research the mechanism further.
