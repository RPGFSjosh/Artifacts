# Hrod
## Overview
The Hrod are a reptilian race that thrives in coastal areas. Among all of the sapient peoples, they have the longest surviving history, having maintained records through the practice of stylized stone carvings. Even the smallest homes are decorated with the basalt, limestone, and marble annals of their ancestors. The most famous emperors and conflicts have megalithic pyramids erected to them and maintained as museums. As a result, the majority of what is known about the lost Savothian empire comes from Hrodic records of their conflicts with the ancient power, though their tendency towards presenting history as parable or metaphor dissuades even the most tenacious scholars from treating these sources as factual.

## Biology
The Hrod resemble the large semi-aquatic archosaurs such as crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials. Typically green or black-skinned with thick, scaly hides providing a natural armor. They are short limbed with long, powerful tails that comprise half of their body length, and they tend to increase in size the longer they live. Powerful swimmers, they are capable of unparalleled bursts of speed in water, giving ambush tactics a special significance in both their wartime strategies and hero stories. Of all sapient peoples, they have the strongest bite by an order of magnitude. Unlike other reptiles, the Hrod are warm-blooded.
