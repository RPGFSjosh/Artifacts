# Savothian
## Overview
Savothians are an amphibious people with webbed hands and feet with coloring and features ranging from vibrant to bland to translucent. According to Hrodic records, the Savothians were the most advanced people in the world for more than a thousand years, living in a single, united amphibious empire hundreds of miles from any coast. They controlled the seas and regularly raided and enslaved terrestrial peoples. Just over 500 years ago, a mysterious cataclysm darkened the sky, and when it cleared the next day, their entire country, Savoth, had vanished, along with its inhabitants. Nearly a century afterwards, amnesiac Savothians began washing up on shores around the world, retaining nothing of their lives before the Doom or any knowledge of the existence of their once great empire. Treated with general distrust, modern Savothians try to make their way in the world like anyone else, enthralled, terrified , or indifferent to the idea of rediscovering their forgotten past.

## Biology
Biologically immortal, Savothians are among the tallest of the humanoid Sapiens and have webbed extremities, granting them superb mobility in water. They have the ability to respirate both in seawater and in the open air. They tend to wear a less permeable base layer of clothing than other peoples to prevent them from losing too much water from their skin. They can shift the coloration of their skin from light to dark in striped patterns. Some cultures use this as communication or as involuntary expression of emotion. Savothians range in height from 5'10"(178cm) to 6'9"(206cm) and in weight from 180lbs(81.6kg) to 290lbs(131.5kg)
