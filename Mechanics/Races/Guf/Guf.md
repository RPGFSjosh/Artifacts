# Guf
## Overview
Historically, the Guf were a loosely-structured nomadic people with strong animistic and shamanistic traditions. Small, insular family groups are found in almost every climate. In more recent times, they have begun to organize, founding the first true Guffan communities, cities, and militias. Their people are adopting trade and have begun competing en masse with other cultures for resources, conflicting most often with the Toldun with whom they share the most biological and social similarities. Their recent societal renaissance has touched every Guf, giving them a culture of fierce comeraderie that they have never had before and inspiring individuals to great feats of both altruism and cruelty.

## Biology
The Guf are a sapient mammalian race resembling suid animals such as hogs, babirusas, and peccaries. They are omnivorous with simple stomachs and possess very coarse and bristly coats. Their heads are large with long snouts supported by thick, stout necks. There is a large variance between the teeth of distinct populations. Some have huge protruding tusks that curl far above the tops of their heads while some have small, straight matched pairs of top and bottom tusks that sharpen each other with moevement, and still others have no tusks whatsoever. Individuals vary wildly in height from 5'5"(165cm) to 7'1"(216cm) and in weight from 150lbs(68kg) to 340lbs(154kg).
