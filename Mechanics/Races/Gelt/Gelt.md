# Gelt
## Overview
The Gelt are known for their extremely self-reliant cultures and their focus on drafting and honoring strict contractual agreements. They expect the same level of fidelity from their employers and subordinates as they do from themselves and are often seen as hard-nosed and shrewd. That being said, they are always looking for a good bargain and detest hidden complications. Individual Gelt who leave Gelt societies often act as mediators, contract negotiators, judges, and administrators. The more unscrupulous among them delight in exploiting loopholes that seem obvious to them but lurk just outside the sight of others, leading other races to coin the phrase "In a Gelt contract, the Gelt win."

## Biology
A stout mammalian people, the Gelt appear to have evolved from the Mustelid family of carnivores. They maintain some fondness for their burrowing ancestry, building cities and even entire countries underground. The social traditions surrounding breeding are extremely complex, as a breeding pair requires the endorsement of family groups and the guilds to whom they are indentured or apprenticed. As a result, clans and families are easily distinguished by their size, pelts, and markings. They typically range in height from 3'8"(130cm) to 5'10"(177cm) and in weight from 90lbs(40.8kg) to 300lbs(136kg).
