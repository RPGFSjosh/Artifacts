# Toldun
## Overview
A soft, simian race, Toldun are widely known for their ability to adapt and adopt new behaviors. Typically looked down on as individuals by the other peoples of the world for their volatility, lack of focus, and middling lifespans, they are nevertheless treated with careful respect when addressed as a group, as their apparent lack of limiting social and physical specializations have repeatedly allowed them to repurpose their civilizations into economic juggernauts at the hint of new resources or into engines of all-out war at the merest provocation.

## Biology
While a relatively slow animal over short distances, Toldun have developed the ability to “sweat” to regulate their body temperature. Small glands within their skin secrete a fast-evaporating mixture of water and minerals, with the heaviest excretions occurring near their core. This, coupled with their disproportionately strong legs and stiff feet, allows them to surpass every other animal in ambulatory speed over time spans longer than 30 minutes. They even compete in extreme foot races lasting for several days and spanning hundreds of miles.
