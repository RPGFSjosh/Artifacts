# Krex

## Overview
The Krex are a flightless feathered race of avian variant humanoids. Generally lightweight and slight, their cultures tend to be reverential and full of ritual song. There are songs for celebration, for courtship, and for slaying. Individuals range from gaudy to reserved both in personality and coloration, making their members easy to find in nearly every profession. They are fast, nimble, quiet, sleek, and fiercely proud. From the time that they are nestlings, they are taught that they will one day return to the skies and rule again above all living things. Other peoples see this belief as haughty and presumptuous. The Krex see it as inevitable.

## Biology
Though incapable of flight, many Krex achieve something near to it for short bursts. Their plumage runs the gamut between the monochromatic dun of some tribes in temperate maritime regions and the brilliant rainbow patterns displaying dozens high contrast iridescents. The longest feathers adorn their arms and tails, helping them to redirect their body weight by affecting air pressure, making them more nimble than other races. Among the many Krex, there are two different mouth shapes; the hard, toothless, and sharp beaks of varying shapes and lengths, and the wider, softer, and toothy bills. Krex range in height from 4' 5"(135cm) to 7'1"(216cm) and in weight from 55lbs(25kg) to 180lbs(81.6kg) due to hollow bones.
