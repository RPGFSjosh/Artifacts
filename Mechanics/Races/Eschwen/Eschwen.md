# Eschwen
## Overview
The Eschwen represent a wide array of mammalian peoples who share similarities with many species of bats. Though able to act as normal during the day, they are very capable in the dark. This affinity expresses itself in various ways throughout their many cultures, painting both Eschwen armies and individuals as historical bogeymen across all of Urd. In appearance, they have short reddish to black fur covering their bodies, sometimes extending up to their faces. Their eyes are larger than most other races. Their noses vary the most between individuals, providing the most visible indicator of ancestry.

## Biology
Eschwen show a high variance between individuals. They range in height from 1.2 meters (4 feet) to 2.1 meters (7 feet). They all share an ability that allows them to locate others in the dark through the use of echolocation. They tend to not store body fat for long, and those that do store it exclusively around their midsection. Their limbs tend to be slender, and do not confer the power of flight, despite their suggested ancestry.
