# Death
 Those on the Path of Death wield the destructive elements of time, subjecting creatures and objects to deterioration and putrefaction in novel and cruel ways. It is only recently that these talents have been seen as anything other than anathema.
 
Players who value doing ongoing damage that slowly ramps up to punishing amounts as combat goes on should consider this Path. Their abilities reward the player for filling the battlefield with dangerous areas and exploit the ongoing effects placed on enemies by your allies and the environment.

| Death HP | + |

## Example Character Concepts
- An experimental surgeon obsessed with the boundary between life and death having used their ability on cadavers for decades before finally deciding to watch how the forces of spontaneous decay affect the living.
- A witch doctor in the swamp who only found out that their patron village had been destroyed once the children stopped visiting them with food offerings. Now, this filthy muck wizard is on the hunt for answers... and revenge.
- A sunny and talented minstrel who hides their fascination with necrotic magics behind narrative songwriting and their public persona. Whereas other bards find themselves vulnerable to the whims of venue owners and opportunistic bouncers, you don't.
