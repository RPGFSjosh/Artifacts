<u>**Description:**</u> As you continue down the Path of Death, you begin to gain control over the flesh of the deceased.

<u>**Effect:**</u> If a creature has died within 1 hour that is your size or larger, you may spend a Swift Action to raise a creature from its remains. You gain one additional Move and Attack Action that your Creatures can use on your turn. You may also grant your own Move or Attack actions to them rather than taking them yourself. They do not act while you are unconscious, and when you die, they do as well. ^a20396

The number and types of creatures you can simultaneously control are limited by your Control Points. You gain 2 Control points now and an additional Control Point for every additional Step you take down the Path of Death from this point forward.
