<u>**Description:**</u> A zone of decay blooms. Light dims. Flowers wither.

<u>**Effect:**</u> Once per round, all creatures that begin their turn within the zone take Death damage. The damage of this effect bypasses armor. The zone persists until you are incapacitated, the scene ends, or you dismiss it as a Swift Action. You may only have one such zone active at a time. ^b688a7
