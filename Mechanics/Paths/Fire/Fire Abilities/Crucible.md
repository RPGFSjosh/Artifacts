<u>**Description:**</u> The building heat that radiates from you becomes its own deterrent.

<u>**Effect:**</u> Every time you hit with an Attack Action that deals Fire Damage, you gain a Crucible Point.  ^eed1f0

Every round where an enemy takes no Fire Damage from one of your active effects or a missed attack, you lose a Crucible Point. You may have a maximum number of Crucible Points equal to your Level. 

Whenever an enemy targets you with a Melee attack, they must first succeed at an Endurance Check. If they succeed, they attack as normal. If they fail, they must choose a different action or no action at all. ^f5fffe
