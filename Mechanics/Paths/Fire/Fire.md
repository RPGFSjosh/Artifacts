# Fire
 Wielders of Fire are living explosions contained in humanoid form. Mastery of this Path chiefly involves learning to covert and control its raw energy into useful work destroying foes and keeping allies safe from the cold.
 
 Those who walk the Path of Fire gain abilities that deal huge amounts of damage to groups of enemies and features that protect your body with flaming retribution. Start down the Path of Fire if you value instant magical damage over all else.

 ## Example Character Concepts
 - A freelance demolitions expert called in to assist with slash-and- burn agriculture or building demo. Recently, they were tasked with incinerating a derelict hut that was a secret hideout for black market bootlegers. Now they're on the run.
 - The unimportant student of a powerful and famous wizard at the head of an academic school of magic. One day you're given a package to deliver to them, and when it breaks accidentally, it reveals a horrific conspiracy that has to be exposed.
 - A disgraced firefighter formerly practicing controlled burns until an unseen force surged through them turning it into an wildly uncontrolled burn. Nobody knows it's your fault, but you need to take a sabbatical to find out who or what compelled you.
