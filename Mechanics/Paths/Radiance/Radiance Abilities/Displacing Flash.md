<u>**Description:**</u> You focus on a point in space and any objects within it. With a flash, you become a blinding bolt of light bridging the two points before appearing at the opposite end.

<u>**Effect:**</u> You teleport to a spot exactly 7 spaces away from where you currently are. All creatures between you and the destination capable of sight take a -2 to [[Attack Rolls|Attack Rolls]] for 1 Round. If a creature or loose object your size or smaller is occupying that space, you and the occupant switch places.
