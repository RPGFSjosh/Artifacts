<u>**Description:**</u> Instead of outward, you focus your radiant energy inward, 

<u>**Effect:**</u> Once per round, you may spend a [[Swift Actions|Swift Action]] to add a charge to [[Supernova|Supernova]]. At the end of each of your turns, you lose Hit Points equal to double the number of charges you have. This loss of life is not mitigated by [[Shielding|Shielding]] or your [[Armor|Armor]].

You may release the charges on your turn as a [[Scene Abilities|Scene]] [[Attack Actions|Attack Action]] to heal all allies and damage all enemies with [[Damage Types|Radiant Damage]] within range. Any enemies or allies not within your direct line of sight (such as having an ally interposed between you and them, or partially obscured by an object) only suffer or benefit from half of this effect.

All allies within range gain [[Shielding|Shielding]] equal to your [[Composure|Composure]]


<u>**Damage and Healing**</u>
>(16 + Level + Number of Charges = [[Dice Tier|Dice Tier]]) + [[Composure|Composure]]
