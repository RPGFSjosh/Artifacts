<u>**Description:**</u>  You split into six identical versions of yourself and occupy all of their perspectives at once.

<u>**Effect:**</u> Create five additional instances of your character.
- Each instance is created two spaces apart from any other version, originating from your space of origin.
- You may split your [[Move Actions|Move Actions]] among all of these forms.
- You do not gain extra Attacks, but may perform actions treating any one of these instances as space of origin. 
- An individual instance vanishes when it takes damage of any kind.
- All remaining copies vanish at the end of the [[Scenes|Scene]], or when you are [[Knocked Flat|Knocked Flat]], rendered [[Unconscious|Unconscious]], Reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|Hit Points]], or suffer a [[Conditions|Condition]] that would entirely remove your ability to focus, such as [[Confusion]].
- When an enemy hits one of your forms, they roll 1d6. 
	- If the die lands on a 1, the attack hits you and functions as normal. If it lands on any other number, that copy is destroyed. 
	- If the die lands on a value higher than the number of remaining instances, the enemy re-rolls that die.
