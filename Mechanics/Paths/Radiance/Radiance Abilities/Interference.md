<u>**Description:**</u> Light blooms around your chosen target, blessing them with a divine aura that wards off attackers.

<u>**Effect:**</u> **[[Boons|Boon:]]** Enemies attacking the subject of this Boon must succeed on a [[Composure|Composure]] Check against your [[Attribute Defenses|Composure Defense]] to target them with attacks. Area attacks are unaffected unless they are the only target within the area. The subject cannot grant [[The Upper Hand|The Upper Hand]] to allies via flanking while this boon is active. If the subject attacks or uses abilities that directly negatively affect enemies, the boon ends.
