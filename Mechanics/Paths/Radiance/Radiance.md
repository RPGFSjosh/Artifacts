# Radiance
The Path of Radiance harnesses the healing and harmful effects of the cosmos. The source of this is unknown. Some view it as simple bodily magics, while the healing effects are viewed by others as a blessing from the stars.

 Radiance grants characters access to ranged features and abilities that simultaneously heal allies and damage enemies, encouraging them to fill the battlefield with radiant explosions of searing light and warming colors. It allows your group to recover both during and after battle so you can continue pushing your limits.

 ## Example Character Concepts
 - A kooky astrologist who constantly makes outlandish predictions of the far future and takes the ability to use their powers as a continued blessing for guessing everything correctly. Often blinds themselves temporarily when scrying.
- An apocalyptic inquisitor of a fire and brimstone clergy tasked with sussing out heresy by letting the damage or healing that their powers do serve as testament to both the heretical nature of their enemies and their own righteousness.
 - The youngest child of a downtrodden family whose emergent restorative powers have prompted their loved ones to encourage them on a pilgrimage of good works while also hoping it will raise their status enough to stave off crippling taxes.
