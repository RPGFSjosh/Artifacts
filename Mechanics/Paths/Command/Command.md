# Command
 The Path of Command values group cohesion over all, forgoing their own actions to allow the group specialists another chance to do what they do best while granting the best possible advantages. It is a thankless job, but someone has to do it.
 
Those on the Path of Command enjoy controlling the shape of combat by creating opportunities for allies, repositioning enemies, and setting cascading traps of actions. If you see the opportunity in your group for a great combination of character abilities, taking a step in Command may be the key that unlocks its greatest potential.

## Example Character Concepts
- The former general of a defeated army exiled as a form of ritual punishment who meets a village of downtrodden farmers with no tools or experience to defend themselves against the criminal strongarm tactics of their local magistrate.
- An imprisoned petty criminal who rises to power in prison once they realize their gift for strategy and interpersonal manipulation. A carefully orchestrated prison riot ends in escape, and now they're ready to hit the world like a bomb.
- A street urchin leading a band of cutpurses in a corrupt dockside city, greasing the palms of the local police to look the other way and frustrating the efforts of a group of geriatric vigilantes with the use of clever pranks.
