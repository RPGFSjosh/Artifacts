<u>**Description:**</u> Your ally didn't miss. It was a ruse! A ruse that you had planned all along!

<u>**Effect:**</u> When an ally misses with a [[Scene Abilities|Scene]] or [[Daily Abilities|Daily]] attack, you may make a [[Basic Attacks|Basic Attack]] against their target. If your attack hits, that ally regains that ability for later use. ^9c5abf
