# Citadel
Path of the Citadel teaches that patience is a virtue that always rewards. It instructs that protecting those around oneself is paramount, and the best way to keep them safe is by blocking their path and baiting them into attacking.

Taking a step down the Path of the Citadel grants players abilities that punish enemies for acting and features that encourage wearing armor by increasing its offensive and defensive effects and reducing its penalties and requirements. Players choose this path to both increase their defense and their opportunities for damage in combat.
