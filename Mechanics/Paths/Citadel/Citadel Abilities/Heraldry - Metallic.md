# [[Heraldry - Metallic|Metallic]]
<u>**Description:**</u> A shiny coat of paint.

<u>**Effect:**</u> When you are included as a target in an attack that would hit multiple spaces, you may choose for it to automatically hit you. If you do, you take damage from the attack as normal, but allies behind you relative to the source of the attack take no damage from the primary hit but still suffer any secondary effects if it hits them.
