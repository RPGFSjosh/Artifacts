<u>**Description:**</u> You charge across the room to preemptively shield vulnerable allies.

<u>**Effect:**</u> You may move up to your [[Speed]] in a straight line. Enemies your size or smaller within your path take [[Damage Types\|Bashing]] damage equal to your [[Armor]] score and move into an unoccupied adjacent space not within your path, if able. 

Until the end of your next turn, allies adjacent to you at the end of this movement may use your Armor score instead of their own so long as they remain adjacent to you.
