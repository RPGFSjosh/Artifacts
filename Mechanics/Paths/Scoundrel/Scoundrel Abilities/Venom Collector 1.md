<u>**Description:**</u> You keep vials of potent venoms on your person and can apply them to your weapons for increased effects.

<u>**Effect:**</u>  You may spend an [[Attack Actions|Attack Action]] to apply or alter a venom to your weapon. These venoms are incredibly volatile and become inert in roughly one minute, so they must be applied during combat.
