#### [[Ambush Tactics - Cutting|Cutting]]
<u>**Effect</u>:** If a target takes damage from your Cutting Weapons, it begins to [[Bleeding|Bleeding]], taking Bleed damage at the end of its turn until it dies or is healed. The damage increases by 1 tier for each time cutting damage is applied by your character. If there are two characters with this ability, their bleed damage increases independently of one another.
