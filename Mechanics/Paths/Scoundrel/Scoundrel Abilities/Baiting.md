<u>**Description:**</u> You redirect an attack meant for you into an adjacent enemy.

<u>**Effect:**</u> When you are hit by a targeted attack while adjacent to an enemy who did not make the attack, you may make a [[Basic Attacks|Basic Attack]] roll. 

If the result of the roll is higher than the attack that hit you, the attack misses you.

If the result of the roll is higher than the non-provoking adjacent enemy's [[Dodge|Dodge]], you may have it hit them instead.

If you attempt this, you may make no more [[Immediate Actions|Immediate Actions]] or [[Opportunity Attacks|Opportunity Attacks]] until the start of your next turn.
