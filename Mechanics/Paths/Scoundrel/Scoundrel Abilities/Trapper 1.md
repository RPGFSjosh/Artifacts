<u>**Description:**</u> You gain the ability to create traps.

<u>**Effect:**</u> As long as you are carrying a [[Trapmaking Kit]], you may spend an [[Attack Actions|Attack Action]] to create one of 3 simple traps. Each trap takes up a single [[Inventory|Slot]], and it requires a [[Move Actions|Move Actions]] to make a [[Stealth|Stealth]] check to place them discreetly.

Traps are triggered when a creature enters the space where the trap is placed.
