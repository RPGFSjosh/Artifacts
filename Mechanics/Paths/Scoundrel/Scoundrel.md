#| Scoundrel
Those who prefer to exploit every opportunity in battle without being bound by tenets of a discipline or who find gallantry in combat a waste of time tend towards Path of the Scoundrel. If the ends justify the means, any means will be used.

The Path of the Scoundrel grants tricks of mobility, burst damage, trips, feints, and traps. It has access to the widest array of solutions for novel situations in combat. Taking a step down this path is a commitment to exploiting clever positioning and punishing opponents for their lack of awareness.

## Example Character Concepts
- A spy embedded in an enemy organization deep in hostile territory, tasked with quietly eliminated every key figure that stands between them and creating an opening that hundreds of their allies can run through.
- A long-distance ranger responsible for mapping the territory and delivering communications between developing nations to establish trade routes. After several bad encounters while totally alone, the idea of honor in combat has been abandoned.
- A military engineer tasked with creating siege engines and covering their tracks with subversive and cruel traps, and orchestrating highly mobile ambushes. Their raw talent for these tactics make the other troops more than a little uneasy.
