 # Champion

Those who value excellence in individual combat tend towards the Path of the Champion. They gain inspiration and vigor from defeating enemies and are immediately driven to greater and greater feats of strength by both their successes and failures.
 
The Features and powers granted by this path focus primarily on dealinge raw damage in melee combat and creating opportunities for more of the same. If a player feels that their character is lacking efficacy when enemies are in their face, taking a step down the Path of the Champion could be an excellent choice.

-  An insecure yet talented martial artist with the need to prove themselves in battle to compensate for a grievous harm done to them as a child. The knowledge of this harm may be actively being leveraged against them to guide their violence.
-  A reluctant soldier who barely survived their first assignment and is sickened by the actions of their army. They have opted out of future service and entered a rebel mercenary group to atone for being complicit in the horror.
