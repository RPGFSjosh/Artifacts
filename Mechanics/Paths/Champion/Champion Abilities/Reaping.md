<u>**Description:**</u> Most would take time to acknowledge the passing of life once an enemy falls. It doesn't even slow you down.

<u>**Effect:**</u> When your attack reduces an enemy to 0 [[Hit Points|Hit Points]], you may move your [[Speed|Speed]] and make a [[Basic Attacks|Basic Attack]] against an enemy that you can see. You may only do this once per round. ^d5493a
