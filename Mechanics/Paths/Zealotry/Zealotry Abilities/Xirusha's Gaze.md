<u>**Description:**</u> You lock eyes with your target and share with them the pain of their past victims.

<u>**Effect:**</u> Target gains 1 random Stage 2 [[Traumas|Trauma]] for 2 rounds. At the start of their turn each round, they may make a [[Composure|Composure]] check against your [[Attribute Defenses|Intellect Defense]] to resist the effects for 1 Round. If they fail, the previous Condition granted by this ability fades, and they must roll for a new one.
