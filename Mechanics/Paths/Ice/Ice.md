# Ice
The Path of Ice focuses on creating objects from water ice. Whether to use them as projectiles, impede the movement of enemies, or just bolster their armor, those on this Path value tend to value creativity, control, and defense.

This Path has the most flexibility of all magical disciplines. It has the potential to do the most single-target damage, control large areas of the battlefield through ice walls and cold zones, and to apply debuffs to enemies that slow their movement and weaken them.
