# Marksman
Those studying the Path of the Marksman value extreme precision with ranged attacks above all else. Adherents tend to learn first on the bow before adapting their skills to other implements, be they magical or mundane.
Taking a step down the Path of the Marksman grants abilities and features that augment all targeted ranged attacks while creating more opportunities for attacks, providing cover fire, and gaining features that increase mobility and add secondary conditions to targets that make them easier for allies to exploit.

## Example Character Concepts
- A hunter who provides game meat for a quiet hillside town and keeps track of wildlife populations to preserve the resource. During a particularly hot summer, a week goes by without them seeing a single creature. Something needs to be done.
- A veteran wartime sniper with notches on their bow for each slain commander and despot. When a counter sniper of an unknown allegiance wipes out their entire company, a long- distance game between murderers begins.
- A shaman known only to nearby peoples as the spirit of the forest, raised in a druidic tradition of preserving true and dangerous wilderness. One day, a raging wildfire destroys their forest and the only home they have ever known
