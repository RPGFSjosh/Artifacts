<u>**Description:**</u> You can bounce a shot off of an object to strike an enemy with the ricochet.

<u>**Effect:**</u> You may fire at a hard object within range to force your projectile to change direction to hit a target. You must have direct Line of Sight to the object, and the object must have [[Line of Sight]] to the Target. For each bounce, the weapon or ability's damage is reduced by 5 tiers. If it would be reduced below tier 1, it cannot hit. The projectile can only move a maximum number of spaces equal to the ability's [[Range Increments|Range]]
