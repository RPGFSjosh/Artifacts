<u>**Description:**</u> You are so used to navigating the ebb and flow of hectic combat with your bow that you are able to put yourself at the most opportune spot to make the most devastating shots.

<u>**Effect:**</u> [[Boons|Boon:]] You enter the Skirmish stance until the end of the scene.

For every consecutive round in which you move 3 or more spaces, you add +1 to your attacks with Ranged Weapons at the beginning of your next turn. This effect stacks. 

For every consecutive round in which you move no more than 1 space, you add +2 to your damage with Ranged Attacks at the beginning of your next turn. This effect stacks.

If you spend a round not satisfying either of the conditions above, that bonus resets.
