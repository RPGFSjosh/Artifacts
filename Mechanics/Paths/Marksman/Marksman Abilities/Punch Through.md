<u>**Description:**</u> Your projectile pierces the weakest point in an opponent's defense and keeps going.

<u>**Effect:**</u> You ignore extra [[Armor|Armor]] equal to your [[Intellect|Intellect]]. If the attack hits, make a second attack roll against a creature beyond the first target in line with you and the target and within your range. The second target is not granted [[Cover]] by the first. If the second attack hits, the second creature takes half the damage of the first hit. ^dbc40d

<u>**Damage**</u>
