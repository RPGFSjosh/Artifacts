# Leveling Up
You begin play at Level 0. To gain a level, you can perform any of the actions listed below:

### Take a Step
With each Step you take down [[Paths|Paths]], your level increases by 1.

To take a Step and gain a level, you must spend 30 [[Momentum|Momentum]]. To take a step of a level higher than One, you must have already taken the proceeding Steps.

For example, if I have Step One [[Fire|Fire]], Step One and Step Two [[Ice|Ice]], while leveling up, I can take a Step One from any Path, Step Two [[Fire|Fire]], or Step Three [[Ice|Ice]].

When you take a Step, you add that Pathâ€™s Step HP to your Maximum Hit Points and gain every ability in that Step.

### Improve an Attribute
With each of your [[Attributes|Attributes]] you increase, your Level increases by 1.

To increase an Attribute by 1 point, you must spend 20 [[Momentum|Momentum]].

When you increase an Attribute this way, you increase your [[Hit Points|Hit Points]] by an amount specific to the chosen Attribute
- [[Strength|Strength]] = 5 HP
- [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] = 5 HP
- [[Intellect|Intellect]] = 4 HP
- [[Composure|Composure]] = 4 HP
- [[Endurance|Endurance]] = 6 HP 

### Advance a Profession
For every 30 Momentum you spend on your [[Professions|Professions]], your level increases by 1

To increase a Profession by 1 point, you must spend 10 Momentum

When you increase a Profession 3 times, you gain 1 level and 4 [[Hit Points|Hit Points]].
