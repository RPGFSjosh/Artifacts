# Prinia
## Description
## History
Was a solo ranger
Kept finding artifacts and turning them in
She liked the bounty, but she really wanted to know what the artifacts were
The Leyliners had constantly tried to recruit her, but she's a bit of a loner
She eventually joined because curiosity overwhelmed her
She resents being in a club, but she tries to hide how interested she is in the missions
She's funny
sardonic
No respect for authority
Enjoys teasing her teammates when they make mistakes
